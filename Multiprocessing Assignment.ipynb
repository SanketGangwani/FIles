    "* Multiprocessing is a python module that provides a simple way to run multiple processes in parallel.\n",
    "* It allows you to take the advantage of multiple cores or processors in your system and can significantly improve the performance of your program.\n",
    "* It allows the execution of multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter, to achieve parallelism and leverage multiple CPU cores for better performance.\n",
    "* It can start multiple processes without waiting for the prior processes to finish and by doing so it can actively execute multiple processes without giving load to one processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Uses__:\n",
    "* Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound processes, such as computationally heavy tasks since it will benefit from having multiple processors.\n",
    "* A practical example may include downloading of files. If a user has sufficiently good speed internet along with a good server then by using multiprocessing,a user can utilize it's resources and improve the efficiency of a program."
